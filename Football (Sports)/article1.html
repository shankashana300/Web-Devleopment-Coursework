                Brazil legend Pele has congratulated Christiano Ronaldo for 
                breaking his record in “official matches” after Ronaldo scored 
                a hat trick in 3-1 victory in Juventus against Cagliari on 14th Sunday.
                <br>
                <br>
                “Life is a solo flight. Each makes his own journey. And what a beautiful
                 journey you are having! I admire you a lot, I love watching you play 
                 and this is no secret to anyone. Congratulations on breaking my record 
                 of goals in official matches,” Pele, said on Instagram, posting a 
                 picture of himself and Ronaldo embracing.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 "My only regret is not being able to give you a hug today. But I leave 
                 this photo in your honor, with great affection, as the symbol of a friendship 
                 that has existed for many years."
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Ronaldo celebrated this huge milestone in his career after the game and 
                 confessed his reason for waiting to acknowledge it.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 "The last few weeks were filled with news and stats considering me 
                 the World's Top Scorer in football history, overcoming Pele's 757 
                 official goals. Although I'm thankful for that recognition, now it's 
                 time for me to explain why I didn't acknowledge that record until 
                 this moment," Ronaldo said in an Instagram post of his own.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 "My everlasting and unconditional admiration for mister Edson Arantes 
                 do Nascimento [Pele], such as the respect that I have for mid-20th 
                 century football, led me to take into account his 767 score, assuming 
                 his 9 goals for Sao Paulo State Team, as well as his single goal for 
                 the Brazilian Military Team, as official goals. The World has changed 
                 since then and football has changed as well, but this doesn't mean that 
                 we can just erase history according to our interests.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                "Today, as I reach the 770.º official goal in my professional career, 
                my first words go straight to @pele . There's no player in the World 
                who hasn't been raised listening to stories about his games, his goals 
                and his achievements, and I'm no exception. And for that reason, I'm filled 
                with joy and pride as I acknowledge the goal that put's me on top of the 
                World's goalscoring list, overcoming Pelé's record, something that I 
                could never have dreamed of while growing up as a child from Madeira.
                <br>
                <br>
                "Thanks to all of those who took part of this amazing journey with me. 
                To my teammates, to my opponents, to the fans of the beautiful game 
                all over the World and, above all, to my family and close friends: 
                trust me when I say that I couldn't have done it without you.
                <br>
                <br>
                "Now I can't wait for the next games and challenges! The next records 
                and trophees! Believe me, this story is still far from being over. 
                The future is tomorrow and there's still a lot to win for Juventus and Portugal!
                <br>
                <br>
                "Join me in this journey! Let's go!"
