                        Manchester City Football Club is an English football club based in Manchester that competes in the Premier League, the top flight of English football. 
						Founded in 1880 as St. Mark's (West Gorton), it became Ardwick Association Football Club in 1887 and Manchester City in 1894. 
						The club's home ground is the City of Manchester Stadium in east Manchester, to which it moved in 2003, having played at Maine Road since 1923. 
						The club adopted their sky blue home shirts in 1894 in the first season of the club's current iteration, that have been used ever since.<br/><br/>

						Manchester City entered the Football League in 1892, 
						and won their first major honour with the FA Cup in 1904. 
						The club had its first major period of success in the late 1960s,
						winning the League, European Cup Winners Cup, FA Cup and League Cup under the management of Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison. 
						After losing the 1981 FA Cup Final, the club went through a period of decline, culminating in relegation to the third tier of English football for the only time in its history in 1998. 
						They since regained promotion to the top tier in 2001–02 and have remained a fixture in the Premier League since 2002–03.r

                        Oottenham Hotspur Football Club, commonly referred to as Tottenham (/ˈtɒtənəm/) or Spurs, 
						is an English professional football club in Tottenham, London, that competes in the Premier League.
						Tottenham Hotspur Stadium has been the club's home ground since April 2019, replacing their former home of White Hart Lane,
						which had been demolished to make way for the new stadium on the same site. Their training ground is on Hotspur Way in Bulls Cross in the London Borough of Enfield.
						The club is owned by ENIC Group. Tottenham have played in a first (home) strip of white shirts and navy blue shorts since the 1898–99 season.
						The club's emblem is a cockerel standing upon a football, with a Latin motto Audere est Facere ("To Dare Is to Do").<br/> <br/>

                        Founded in 1882, Tottenham won the FA Cup for the first time in 1901, the only non-League club to do so since the formation of the Football League in 1888. 
						Tottenham were the first club in the 20th century to achieve the League and FA Cup Double, winning both competitions in the 1960–61 season.
						After successfully defending the FA Cup in 1962, in 1963 they became the first British club to win a UEFA club competition – the European Cup Winners' Cup.
						They were also the inaugural winners of the UEFA Cup in 1972, becoming the first British club to win two different major European trophies. 
						They collected at least one major trophy in each of the six decades from the 1950s to 2000s – an achievement only matched by Manchester United.
						In total, Spurs have won two league titles, eight FA Cups, four League Cups, seven FA Community Shields, one European Cup Winners' Cup and two UEFA Cups.
						Tottenham were also the runners-up in the 2018–19 UEFA Champions League. They have a long-standing rivalry with nearby club Arsenal, with whom they contest the North London derby.
