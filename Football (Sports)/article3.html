                LONDON, United Kingdom â€” This was a win for both Mikel Arteta and Arsenal. 
                An afternoon that started with Arsenal facing unexpected disciplinary problems 
                ended with a win over Tottenham Hotspur, who had Erik Lamela sent off after 
                scoring a goal that could be considered for the season's best goal.
                <br>
                <br>
                The irony is not lost on Arteta, who wanted to bench club captain Pierre-Emerick 
                Aubameyang after he arrived late for training. It was a divisive decision, 
                made all the more so by Aubameyang's recent form (nine goals in his last 12 appearances) 
                and the identity of their rivals, who had been buoyed by recent results and a sense that 
                Son Heung-Min, Gareth Bale, and Harry Kane were finally forming the formidable triumvirate 
                that had been predicted earlier in the season.
                <br>
                <br>
                Son was forced to leave the field after 20 minutes with an injury, Bale was replaced 
                before the hour mark, and Kane was largely unnoticed before a late flurry in which 
                he had a goal disallowed for offside and hit the post with a late free kick.
                <br>
                <br>
                Spurs didn't deserve anything from this, and Arteta deserves credit for that. Aubameyang 
                is a strong figure in the Arsenal dressing room, and the manager must have understood 
                the repercussions of leaving his talisman out too late. After a 3,000-mile round trip 
                to Athens for their Europa League last-16 first-leg tie at Olympiakos, the Gunners were 
                also exhausted, while on the same night, Spurs hosted Dinamo Zagreb in north London.
                <br>
                <br>
                Apart from the final frantic 10 minutes or so, when Spurs eventually decided to crack the 
                cautious Jose Mourinho mould and go on the offensive, Arsenal were the more energetic team 
                throughout. As it turns out, Arteta could still earn three points by making his case on 
                Aubameyang.
                <br>
                <br>
                "I made what I thought was the right decision and we draw a line there and now let's move 
                on again," he said. "We know how important Auba is for us and for the club and that's it. 
                It's been dealt with, now let's move on.
                <br>
                <br>
                "For me, [off-field standards] are the foundation and the platform that we can build something 
                medium and long-term that is sustainable and that can bring us joy and happiness. Without that, 
                I don't believe that it would happen. That's why I keep talking about it and acting about it."
