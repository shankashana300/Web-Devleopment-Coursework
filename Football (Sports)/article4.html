                Although the England international has just one Premier League goal this season, 
                his all-round performance in Sunday's 1-0 win over West Ham was impressive.
                <br>
                <br>
                You could tell it wasn't going to be Mason Greenwood's night when Lukasz Fabiankski 
                tipped Mason Greenwood's powerful shot onto the post in the 35th minute of Manchester 
                United's 1-0 victory over West Ham on Sunday.
                <br>
                <br>
                Greenwood's effort would have definitely hit the bottom corner of the Irons' net 
                last season, such was his finishing prowess.
                <br>
                <br>
                However, in 2020-21, the youngster's goal-scoring ability has waned. 
                This season, he has just one Premier League goal and four in all competitions.
                <br>
                <br>
                Greenwood will be looking to build on that statistic in the final months of the season, 
                particularly because a chance to prove himself as a central striker appears to be 
                on the horizon.
                <br>
                <br>
                Greenwood began his Old Trafford career in that role, and it was Greenwood who provided much 
                of United's attacking thrust as they attempted to break down a West Ham side that David Moyes 
                had set up to frustrate their hosts.
                <br>
                <br>
                As the Red Devils failed to break down their visitors from east London, Greenwood had five shots 
                on the night, the most of any player on the field, and hit the woodwork in both halves.
                <br>
                <br>
                Greenwood's future is expected to see him play more and more as a No.9 as he grows older and stronger, 
                but there could be an opportunity now if he can prove himself in the role.
                <br>
                <br>
                Anthony Martial has fallen short of expectations this season, scoring only four goals in 17 Premier 
                League appearances, and Greenwood will definitely provide more dynamism to United's attack than the 
                France international.
                <br>
                <br>
                The other choice is Edinson Cavani, a much more conventional No.9 who has looked like United's 
                missing piece inside the penalty area for most of the season. However, with the ex-Paris Saint-Germain 
                man reportedly disappointed in England and ready to depart, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer looks set for a summer 
                in which he will have to rethink his options in attack once more.
                <br>
                <br>    
                The Norwegian can either re-enter the market in search of a world-class striker, or he can go 
                into 2021-22 with only Martial and Greenwood vying for a starting spot.
                <br>
                <br>
                With United's budget limitations due to the pandemic, they can only really afford to invest big 
                on one place, and it was often thought that money will be spent on a centre-back before the revelations 
                from Cavani's father.
                <br>
                <br>
                But, with the Uruguayan on the verge of leaving and United having kept four consecutive Premier 
                League clean sheets, their goals in the market must yet change.It's worth considering whether 
                Greenwood would be forced to remain central if he had a stronger presence on the right side than Daniel James, 
                but there's also a case to be made that he just needs more games in the role to understand its intricacies.
