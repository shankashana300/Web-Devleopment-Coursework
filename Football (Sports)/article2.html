                Ole Gunner Solskjaer of MANCHESTER, England will be talking a lot 
                about “development” between now and the and of the season. 
                It will be a much easier conversation if this week goes well, 
                which United started with a crucial 1-0 win over West Ham United on 
                Sunday at Old Trafford.
                <br>
                <br>
                As the desire to end the season with a positive note strengthens, 
                Solskjaer’s team now move on to competitions they can still win -- first 
                against AC Milan in the Europa League and then against Leicester 
                City in the FA Cup. If they finish second in the Premier League and 
                win a trophy, Solskajaer would not have be bothered about a debate 
                on whether United are on the right track.
                <br>
                <br>
                The first leg of what is a crucial run of three games has been safely 
                negotiated and with nine league games to go, United are nine points 
                clear of West Ham in fifth. With the possibility of being dragged 
                into a battle for the top four is getting lower, focus now can be 
                on topping the last season’s finish and winning a trophy.
                <br>
                <br>
                "This week was always going to be massive, we want to improve on last 
                season and get to a final and move up the table. This week was always 
                going to be about how we recovered after a massive disappointment after 
                a late equaliser [against Milan on Thursday]. You never know how that 
                can affect you but the attitude was spot on,” said Solskjaer afterwards.
                <br>
                <br>
                Solskjaer also added, "We're starting to build some momentum in the 
                league and open the gap further to West Ham. It's a big week for us.
                <br>
                <br>
                Victory over West Ham was a close call but it has given United Some 
                momentum at the start of an important week. But after four semifinal 
                defeats, pressure on Solskajaer to win something is increasing gradually.
